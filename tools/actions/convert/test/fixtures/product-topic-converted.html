            <h2>Key Takeaway Text Example:</h2>
            <p>The most important thing to consider for your experiment is keeping your sample alive and healthy during sample preparation and imaging. Thus, it is critical to maintain the sample in an environment that resembles as closely as possible physiological conditions, i.e., temperature, pH, oxygen levels, and other important factors.</p>

      <p>The understanding of complex and/or fast cellular dynamics is an important step for exploring biological processes. Therefore, today’s life science research is increasingly focused on dynamic processes like cell migration, morphological changes of cells, organs, or whole animals, and real-time physiological (e.g., changes of intracellular ion composition) events in living specimens. One approach to address these challenging demands is to employ certain optical methods that are collectively called live-cell imaging.</p>
      <p>Live-cell imaging provides, in real time, a “snapshot” of a cell’s or organism’s current state in its native environment without introducing artifacts typical of fixation. These capabilities make live-cell imaging a requisite technique for addressing questions in cell biology, cancer research, developmental biology, and neuroscience.</p>
      <p>In recent years, substantial advances in electronics, optics, and fluorescent tag technology have made live-cell imaging more versatile and easily accessible for scientists.</p>
      <h1>Consideration for optimal fluorescence live-cell imaging</h1>
      <h2>Keeping your sample under physiological conditions:</h2>
      <p>The most important thing to consider for your experiment is keeping your sample alive and healthy during sample preparation and imaging. Thus, it is critical to maintain the sample in an environment that resembles as closely as possible physiological conditions, i.e., temperature, pH, oxygen levels, and other important factors.</p>
      <h2>Minimum stress from light exposure:</h2>
      <p>Exposing live cells to light causes phototoxicity and changes in the physiology of your specimen, so that you might get results that do not resemble what actually happens in a healthy organism. To avoid phototoxicity as much as possible, widefield microscopes are often the technology of choice for imaging live specimens. They illuminate the sample with low doses of LED light to excite fluorophores and image acquisition is faster than other microscopy methods, such as confocal imaging.</p>

      <h2>Photoactivation – monitoring gene expression and protein transport</h2>
      <p>Photoactivation, a recently developed method, selectively labels areas of interest within a cell or organism by using especially designed dyes, such as photoactivated-green-fluorescent protein (paGFP) or Kaede. These dyes only show significant fluorescence after illumination with light of a specific wavelength. These dyes can also be fused to a protein of interest to study its expression or transport dynamics by using FRAP or particle tracking.</p>
