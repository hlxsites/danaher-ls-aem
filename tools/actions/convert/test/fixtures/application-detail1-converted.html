            <p>Technological revolutions in genetic engineering and oligonucleotide synthesis are allowing bioengineers to innovate using the power of biology. Nucleotides and enzymes are the new nuts and bolts used to create novel biologically derived drug products. Applications for synthetic biology in the pharmaceutical industry aim to advance human health by delivering sustainably sourced, scalable alternatives to traditional chemically synthesized medicines.</p>
            <p>Synthetic biology is tied to iterative engineering process steps. Synthesis of DNA templates and product expression is followed by rounds of analysis and optimization until products are ready for scale up. Create a synthetic biology workflow that includes validated analytical methods and data management solutions that will capture every step of the cycle.</p>
            <p>Our Danaher Life Sciences companies provide a wide range of analytical solutions and fit-for-purpose technologies to accelerate synthetic biology workflow development and shorten the iterative bioengineering cycle. We enable seamless tech transfer to manufacturing and offer flexible technologies for both upstream and cGMP environments.</p>
