            <h3>How does a microplate reader work?</h3>
            <p>A microplate reader operates by illuminating samples in microplate wells with specific wavelengths of light, measuring the resulting absorbance, fluorescence, or luminescence signals emitted by the samples. These signals are then quantified and analyzed, providing insights into various biological and biochemical processes within the samples, such as protein interactions, enzymatic reactions, or cell viability assessments.</p>

            <h3>How is a spectrophotometer different from a Biotech microplate reader?</h3>
            <p>A microplate reader is optimized for high-throughput analysis of samples in microplate formats, offering capabilities for fluorescence, luminescence, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements, ideal for assays like ELISA and gene expression studies. In contrast, a spectrophotometer is versatile for absorbance measurements in cuvettes, accommodating single-sample measurements. It is commonly used for applications like nucleic acid quantification and protein analysis.</p>

            <h3>Differentiate between the different types of dedicated microplate readers.</h3>
            <p><strong>Absorbance Readers:</strong> We carry absorbance spectrophotometers and multi-well plate readers for UV-Vis absorbance detection. These 96-well microplate readers or 384-well plate readers offer higher throughput, measuring absorbance in microplates by vertically passing light through each well.</p>
            <p><strong>Fluorescence Readers:</strong> Multi-wavelength measurement is achieved without filters through our top- and bottom-reading microplate readers. These readers feature dual monochromators, offering flexibility in establishing the best excitation and emission parameters for fluorescence intensity assays. Cell-based assay sensitivity is enhanced through well scanning at multiple points.</p>
            <p><strong>Luminescence Readers:</strong> A specialized microwell plate reader, known as a luminometer, is designed for single-mode luminescence detection. Luminescence detection is known for its heightened sensitivity compared to absorbance or fluorescence detection methods. These luminescence plate readers are exceptionally well-suited for quantifying various assays.</p>
            <p><strong>Microplate washers:</strong> Microplate washers simplify usage with walk-up convenience and user-changeable heads. They minimize processing time, reduce residual volume, and simplify operation while minimizing wash duration.</p>
            <p><strong>Multi-mode readers:</strong> While a single-mode plate reader is a suitable initial choice, opting for an upgradable multi-mode reader that encompasses absorbance, fluorescence, and luminescence functions can effectively cater to your evolving laboratory requirements. Our multi-mode plate readers offer customizable features for fluorescence polarization (FP), time-resolved fluorescence (TRF), HTRF, and AlphaScreen. Additionally, these readers provide the opportunity to integrate upgradeable modules such as western blot capabilities, cell imaging, and fast kinetics with injectors.</p>
