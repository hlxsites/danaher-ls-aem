      <h2><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h2>
      <h2>Leverage a partner with an extensive portfolio and accelerate your Cell Line Development</h2>
      <p>Antibody drugs, including mAbs, bi- and trispecific antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates, are a changing how we treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. Antibodies are derived from engineered producer cell lines.</p>
      <p>Cell line development (CLD) is no simple task. Putting a lifesaving biologic, such as a targeted monoclonal antibody, on the market requires years of drug discovery research, development, clinical trials and scaling up for commercialization. Establishing cell lines is a long process, with numerous steps and challenges.</p>
      <p>Our Danaher Life Sciences companies support biopharma and service providers in their endeavor to accelerate the CLD process with its comprehensive platform of best-in-class science and technology companies. We recognize the necessity for solutions that eliminate bottlenecks faster and aim to address this with our extensive instrument, software, and services portfolio.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>What is cell line development, and why is it important?</h3>
            <p>Cell line development (CLD) is the process of bioengineering cells or cellular expression systems to stably express and manufacture biotherapeutics or biological products such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins and enzymes. CLD ensures consistent quality and output for products used by multiple fields, including medicine, clinical research, diagnostics, life sciences, agriculture, forensics and industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>How long does it typically take to develop a stable cell line?</h3>
            <p>While producing a stable cell line requires multiple variables, the total time can range from 6 to 12 months. Processes like transfection, cloning, stability studies, assay development and scale-up require attention to detail, are generally lengthy, labor-intensive, or can require optimization, contributing to the overall timeline.</p>
            <p>Danaher Life Sciences operating companies can help identify high-producing cell lines within 15 minutes &#x26; save over 14,000 hours in stable cell line development with their portfolios of instruments, software and services.</p>

            <h3>What are the challenges faced during cell line development?</h3>
            <p>Though cell line development has many advantages, the process comes with challenges.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>It is a time-consuming process. Process mistakes or optimization can add weeks or months, which impacts other projects.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>It is labor-intensive. A lot of effort goes into maintaining a sterile environment throughout the process. Screening, identifying, monitoring, characterizing cell lines and maintaining data integrity requires a coordinated effort.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Process scale-up is not always linear. Sometimes the selected clone(s) do not perform as expected, which can increase time and costs.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Danaher Life Sciences operating companies can help address these cell line development challenges with their portfolios of instruments, software and services.</p>

        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>How are cell lines authenticated and characterized?</h3>
            <p>Cell line authentication and characterization can be done using a battery of test methods. Genomic sequencing and PCR-based methods are commonly employed. Functional tests and immunophenotyping are also performed. Data is then compared against known databases with previously authenticated cell lines for confirmation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>What is stable cell line development?</h3>
            <p>Stable cell line development results in a genetically stable clone with an integrated transgene passed down to all subsequent daughter cells. Stable cell lines are crucial for drug research, screening, and manufacturing therapeutic proteins and biologics.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>What are the advantages of using an established cell line over primary culture?</h3>
            <p>In research, established cell lines offer the following advantages over primary cultures:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Optimized costs and timelines</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Ease of use</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Availability of samples</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Reduced dependency on human or animal tissue</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Reproducibility of results</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>What is the importance of cell line characterization?</h3>
            <p>Proper cell line characterization is crucial to avoid using wrongly identified or contaminated cell lines, resulting in inaccurate research outcomes and wasting effort, cost and time. International regulatory agencies like WHO, FDA, ICH and EMA have well-defined compliance requirements and procedures for cell line characterization in all cell banks used in biologics, therapeutic research and manufacturing.</p>
