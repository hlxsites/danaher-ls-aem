      <h2><strong>APPLICATIONS</strong></h2>
      <h2>Applications of Capillary Electrophoresis Systems</h2>
      <p>We have a range of capillary electrophoresis equipment, each designed for your specific applications. If you are working in the following areas, our automated capillary electrophoresis systems are what you need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>**Genomic research: **Our extremely versatile capillary electrophoresis systems are designed to streamline your quantitative gene expression, genetic sequencing, DNA sequencing, STR analysis, genotyping, and/or fragment analysis experiments. The integration of high-throughput features, such as an integrated barcode reader, eight capillary arrays, and diode lasers, ensures higher sensitivity, processing of an increased number of samples, and accurate tracking and reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Drug development:</strong> Our automated and robust capillary electrophoresis systems streamline screening protocols used in forensic toxicology. They allow high-resolution separation of up to 20 basic drugs using low pH.</li>
        <li><strong>Petrochemical industry:</strong> The analysis of anion and cation contents of petroleum or related products offers in-depth insight into its chemical composition. For instance, extremely pure terephthalic acid (PTA) and its esters are crucial in making plastics and fibers such as polyester. The quality and color of the final products are directly influenced by how pure the PTA is. Our advanced capillary electrophoresis system smoothly facilitates such applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Water quality and environmental analysis:</strong> Our capillary gel electrophoresis instruments are integrated with high-throughput features that accelerate your quantitative and qualitative analytical processes with high efficiency and resolution and offer reliable and accurate results with high eff. You can easily identify contaminants in water and soil samples that lead to environmental pollution and analyze analytes involved in corrosion. Whatever your applications are, you will find our CE system best suits your applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other than the applications mentioned above, our capillary electrophoresis systems help you in the following areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plasmid DNA manufacturing</li>
        <li>Antisense oligonucleotide development and manufacturing</li>
        <li>mRNA development and manufacturing</li>
        <li>Cell line development</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2>
      <h2>Capillary Electrophoresis System - Product Highlights/Key Features  </h2>
      <p>Our capillary gel electrophoresis instruments are equipped with advanced features to automate and streamline your genetic analysis, DNA sequencing, and DNA analysis workflows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Our systems enable simultaneous parallel processing of 8 samples that improve operation efficiency and effectiveness. It retains the ability to conduct delicate analyses like capillary electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS), ribonucleic acid (RNA), capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF), and glycan characterization analysis. This ensures precise results for extensive sample sets and reduces the time required to obtain answers from your experiments.</li>
        <li>To help you obtain reliable, accurate, and reproducible data, our systems are equipped with high-sensitivity UV and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detectors. They also offer you raw and unmanipulated data for your product submission and commercialization.</li>
        <li>We also have capillary electrophoresis systems that eliminate dead volume through a single continuous separation capillary contained within the OptiMS cartridge. Further, our proprietary factory-built multi-capillary and temperature-controlled cartridge ensures maximum data reproducibility in analytical processes.</li>
        <li>Our automated capillary electrophoresis machines enable multiple injections from a small sample volume (as little as 5 μL) to help you extract the most information possible from your limited samples.</li>
        <li>Our systems have a built-in auto-sampler and a programmable array range of up to 36 pairs of buffers, which help precisely measure the right amount of each sample and load it into the analysis system without error, ensuring accuracy and consistency in results.</li>
      </ul>

            <h3>What is the principle of Capillary electrophoresis?</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9073252/"><strong>When a high-voltage power supply</strong></a> or an electric field is applied to a capillary tube carrying the sample in buffer solution, the charged ions start moving to different ends of the capillary based on their charge and size. If two molecules are the same size, they separate based on the charge they carry. The cations move toward the negatively charged cathode, and the anions move toward the anode that is positively charged. In cases where two ions have the same charge, they move based on their size (such as the smaller ion moves faster than the larger ion).</p>
