      <h2>A complete solution for the automated screening and objective selection of high-value clones across diverse cell types.</h2>
      <p>The ClonePix® 2 Mammalian Colony Picker is a fully automated system for selecting high-value clones used in antibody discovery and cell line development. Screen more clones in less time with monoclonal verification on day zero, then screen and identify for highest producers in weeks, not months.</p>
      <p>Hybridomas, CHO cells, stem cells and other cell types are imaged and selected based on user-defined parameters. Plate handling, barcode reading, and picking are fully integrated, and all data, including images, are saved for downstream analysis. The picker increases the probability of finding optimally produced cell lines and significantly reduces time and labor.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced for stem cell applications*</h2>
            <p><strong>Identify desirable, clonal stem cell colonies for high-throughput colony screening and picking</strong></p>
            <p>High-resolution imaging identifies desirable, clonal stem cell colonies for high-throughput colony screening and picking. Specialized picking pins allow the gentle transfer of adherent, feeder-free cells to high-density plates for clonal expansion and downstream analysis.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Colony formation</strong> - Individual stem cells plated at a low density in 6-well plates divide and develop into colonies. Plating density is kept low to ensure that colonies are derived from a single parent cell.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Clone screening</strong> - Clonally-derived stem cell colonies are identified by their desirable morphological characteristics and are picked from the low-density 6-well plates into higher density 96-well plates to carry forward with the screening. The ClonePix® 2 Mammalian Colony Picker can be customized with high-resolution optics and stem cell-specific pins, allowing this established technology to be leveraged in stem cell workflows.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Cell growth</strong> - Cell growth is determined by monitoring cell division over a given time using label-free imaging.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Functional screening</strong> - In addition to monitoring growth, functional cell-based assays can be performed. This can include assays assessing differentiation potential, pluripotency, ability to form 3D organoids, and other desirable traits.</p>
