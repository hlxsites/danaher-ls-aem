      <p>Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) is a common analytical method for detecting the presence and concentration of antibodies, antigens, proteins, and glycoproteins in a variety of sample types. ELISAs are desirable for their high specificity and sensitivity. There are many variations of ELISAs commonly used in analytical laboratories:</p>

            <h2>Direct ELISA</h2>
            <p>This method employs a fluorescent or biotin-streptavidin tagged primary antibody that will elicit a readable signal after stimulation and binding to an immobilized antigen.</p>

            <h2>Indirect ELISA</h2>
            <p>This is a modified format of the direct ELISA approach that utilizes a tagged secondary antibody that binds to the unlabeled primary antibody of the antibody-immobilized antigen complex. The tag is typically fluorescent or a biotin-streptavidin complex.</p>

            <h2>Sandwich ELISA</h2>
            <p>A spin on the indirect ELISA, this method utilizes an immobilized capture antibody to interact with a target antigen. This is followed by a step using an unlabeled primary antibody to bind to the target antigen-capture antibody complex. The final step before signal detection is to use a tagged secondary antibody that is highly specific to the unlabeled primary antibody.</p>

            <h2>Competitive ELISA</h2>
            <p>This assay is typically used to determine concentrations of a target antigen in a sample. The process is characterized by an immobilized capture antibody of a specific quantity that is designed to bind to the target antigen and a competing antigen. The tagged target antigen signal is analyzed to determine relative concentration.</p>

      <p>Despite the ubiquity of the ELISA technique, numerous reagent additions, washes and incubation steps make ELISAs a complex and labor-intensive procedure with potential for variability in results.</p>
      <p>Automation of these steps relieves the labor burden with improved throughput, consistency and high efficiency enabling simultaneous analyses on a single workstation.</p>
      <p>Our Danaher Life Sciences companies provide a wide range of solutions and fit-for-purpose technologies for partial or end-to-end ELISA workstations for method development and implementation.</p>
