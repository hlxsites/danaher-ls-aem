      </p>
      <p>The genome is the blueprint for life, consisting of genes made up of thousands of pairs of DNA bases. Altering one base pair can drastically change how the gene’s protein product functions, while mutations can lead to the development of a range of genetic disorders.</p>
      <p><a href="/us/en/library/crispr-cas9.html">CRISPR</a> allows researchers to target and edit specific genes in order to better understand the genome, human diseases and the effects of specific mutations. The development of CRISPR has opened the door to ending diseases by fixing mutations and developing therapies through the process of modeling mutations. Scientists use complex gene editing and disease modeling systems to gain insights on the potential of CRISPR.</p>
      <p>Most gene editing studies are performed in traditional 2D culture systems that model a simplified version of the tissue and biology in question. These 2D culture systems typically consist of one cell type that forms into a single layer of cells. While these studies demonstrate how one cell type behaves when a gene’s sequence is altered, their simplified nature makes it difficult to know how that cell, or the entire tissue, would respond within the body when that same sequence is altered. The need for greater complexity of cell-based systems has led to the development of organoids.</p>
      <h3>What are organoids?</h3>
      <p>Organoids are 3D tissue models consisting of multiple cell types that could bridge the gap between traditional 2Din vitrocultures and the actualin vivotissue of the body.</p>
